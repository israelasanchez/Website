    <h1>How I Got Into Gaming</h1>
    <h2>First Person Shooters and RPG Games</h2>
      <p>I grew up playing first person shooter games like Call of Duty and Halo, but now I play Apex Legends and Rainbow 6 Siege. Before I played FPS games I played RPG games, RPG is short for Roll Playing Games. Bulders Gate 2 and Lord of the Rings games opened the door to gaming for me.</p>
