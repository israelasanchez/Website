    <h1>How I Got Into Gaming</h1>
    <h2>First Person Shooters and RPG Games</h2>
      <p>I grew up playing first person shooter games like Call of Duty and Halo, but now I play Apex Legends and Rainbow 6 Siege. Before I played <em>FPS</em> games I played <em>RPG</em> games, RPG is short for <em>Roll Playing Games</em>. Bulders Gate 2 and Lord of the Rings are older RPG's that opened the doors to gaming for me.</p>
